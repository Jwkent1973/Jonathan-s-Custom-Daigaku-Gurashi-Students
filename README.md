# Jonathan-s-Custom-Diagaku-Gurashi-Students

Decided to just make my own little repository of the custom students I made.  File names will start with the version number they will work with.. For a whole lot more students, Please check out Arbiter1223's Repository that has way more students to try.

UPDATE: May 18, 2019 - Updated and added new versions to work with v035. I will also leave my older versions up as well. Just scroll down to the files starting with the version of Diagaku Gurashi you have.

UPDATE: May 27, 2019 Added 2 new students, Linata (A friendlier Hinata) And Lioshi (A nicer Kioshi) Gave them both a different look so you can tell them apart. 

UPDATE: July 13, 2019 Added new versions of these students to work with v0.37 and 0.39.
